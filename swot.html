                    <li><b>Quality and quanitity of information</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The things that should be kept in the redesign is of course the information written about the products and the pictures provided. Using their written content ensures brand consistency.</li>
                            <li>Other things that should be included are the links to share their site on Twitter & Facebook; allowing for greater cross-internet engagement and SEO.</li>
                            <li>Moreover, we want to keep the contact page, reviews, map location, background images, and logo for the redesign.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Good first impression</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The thing that can be highlighted the most on the webpage is the product portion and possibly even the home page. Highlighting the product page will help generate more sales and increase the Popcorn Store’s brand awareness.</li>
                            <li>In that same vein, we should bring more attention to the seasonal tins as limited-time-offers, thus increasing their desirability.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Time spent in the community</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The one thing that sets this business apart from the surrounding competitors is that it is a family run business that has been a part of the community for a long while (since 1982).</li>
                            <li>This is something we can continue to display on our website, drawing attention to the fact that the Popcorn Store is a long-standing member of the community. When people shop with us, they will feel like they are a part of Arlington’s history.</li>
                        </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Lack of usability</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The website, in its current state, features a navigation menu that is both cluttered and difficult to read.</li>
                            <li>This is especially problematic when considering a part of our target audience are families; we should be cognizant of those with accessibility issues, like poor eyesight.</li>
                            <li>As such, we can reduce the amount of main navigation links, increase the font size, and use a higher color contrast. In doing so, we can ensure a legible and accessible navigation for all users.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Lack of accessibility and access</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>People using screen readers have complained that our image content lacks any alt text. This is a major concern for accessibility and ADA compliance.</li>
                            <li>In addition, the home page includes multiple background images and non-decorative content -- increasing the load time by quite a bit. This is a major issue for those browsing this site on a mobile device or with a poor Internet connection.</li>
                            <li>In order to solve this, we can reduce the amount of image content on the home page -- and even more so for those browsing on mobile. For example, the removal of decorative background images on mobile through the use of media queries. We can also include alt text for all images to help those using screen readers.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Ineffective use of footer</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Popcorn Store website could benefit from the inclusion of a footer navigation; one that includes all links in order to streamline the website hierarchy.</li>
                            <li>This would allow people to quickly jump to whichever page they need to, without browsing one-by-one; thereby reducing our weaknesses in accessibility.</li>
                            <li>It would be beneficial to include reviews of our products natively on the website, so that people do not have to navigate to other businesses or forums. In doing so, we can ensure that our users stay on and browse our website for as long as possible.

                    <li><b>Promoting the health benefits</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Obesity has been a long-standing problem and global disease for Americans specifically. The obesity rate found in 2020 for America is that of 40.3%, with no signs of giving out</li>
                            <li>Popcorn has been known for its health benefits, such as protein, fibers, and antioxidants. Promoting the health benefits during a climate in which people snack on less favorable items will be sure to help us in the long run.</li>
                            <li>The taste is most important of course, but while we are designing our website, we can also include the health benefits that go into each of our products, so the people that do care can at least feel satisfied with what they are getting.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Growing population</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Arlington is a fast growing city, seeing a 9.54% population increase since 2010. As the population grows, so too do the families and college students who make up our target audience.</li>
                            <li>Due to the increase in population, there are more people going to movies, sporting events, and other snack worthy activities, which tend to involve popcorn. The increase in people doing these activities is better for our sales and brand awareness.</li>
                            <li>COVID-19 has ramped up the anticipation to get to these events and gatherings, giving us something to capitalize on in the near future.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>New Technologies</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There has been a significant growth of mobile apps as counterparts to websites. This is something we could potentially include to not only increase accessibility, but also to promote our business on mobile app stores.</li>
                            <li>Online ordering is becoming a big part of restaraunt servcies, especially during Covid-19. We could partner with an ordering service in order to provide customers with immediate popcorn delivery.</li>
                            <li>The Popcorn Store could benefit from including Google or Apple maps applets and embedded reviews. This would ensure that users stay on our site for longer, and would not need to navigate to other locations. In that sense, the website would be a one-stop-shop for everything related to our business.</li>
                        </ul>

            <td>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Online store fronts</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The most serious external threat that The Popcorn Store faces would be online store fronts like Amazon syphoning away business by taking advantage of their higher capital for advertising. </li>
                            <li>To remedy this, we must ensure the website redesign adopts a modern look to compete with other modern storefronts to minimize customer loss to bigger corporations. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>People not needing their services or products</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We aren’t currently in a season where big parties aren’t happening, like currently with the pandemic or during the winter months when there aren’t a lot of get-togethers. </li>
                            <li>A solution we can provide for this with our redesign will be strongly advertising the larger sized popcorn products that are normally bought for these kinds of events, and instead market them as a value option. If we see sales of a specific size drop due to a specific season, we can anticipate to cut prices and advertise for that product to counteract it.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Other novelty local stores</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Many of these markets also advertise their business as “homemade”, which is in direct competition for the angle The Popcorn Store is looking to handle.</li>
                            <li>We can mitigate revenue loss and foster beneficial relationships if we look to offer alliances with these other businesses and attend local trade markets with them to market our products together. We can reflect this in the website redesign by outlining what businesses we’ll be with and where we’ll be together. </li>
                        </ul>
