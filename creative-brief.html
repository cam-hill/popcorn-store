            <h3>Project Background</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Client:</b> The Popcorn Store, a family owned popcorn store in Lincoln Square Arlington Texas.</li>
                <li><b>Product/Service:</b> Gourmet Popcorn; they have other products centering around the primary product of popcorn such as party favors and gallon tin cans.</li>
                <li><b>SWOT:</b> <a href="swot.html">SWOT Analysis</a></li>
                <li><b>Exisiting Research:</b> Currently there is no current research available.</li>

        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="overview">
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Project type:</b> This project involves the redesign of The Popcorn Store website.</li>
                <li><b>Reason for the project:</b> Our group is designing The Popcorn Store website. In doing so,
                    we hope to encourage greater awareness of our client’s brand and the products that they offer.
                    Through this, we aim to design a website that’s accessible to all audiences -- most especially
                    our target market. </li>
                <li><b>Opportunities:</b> The growth of Arlington as a college-town may allow niche clients -- such
                    as The Popcorn Store -- to service a greater audience. Among other things, we aim to capitalize
                    on this population change with a targeted website redesign.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Drivers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Goals:</b> Our goal when redesigning the commercial website for The Popcorn Store will be to
                    increase customer engagement with products, as well as to provide a more user friendly experience
                    while navigating the site.</li>
                <li><b>Top three objectives:</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Increase the usability of the site and make navigation more intuitive.</li>
                        <li>Lining up the site’s design philosophy with the business philosophy of The Popcorn Store
                            by making the visuals more engaging.</li>
                        <li>Optimizing page count and layout to ensure there isn’t repeated information</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><b>Project length:</b> The estimated completion time for the project in line with the course
                    assignments is projected to be about 3 months. This process includes complete analysis of the
                    current website and the deployment of the new redesign</li>
                <li><b>Length of time until goal is achieved:</b> The client can expect specific parts of the redesign
                    process to be done by specific dates. By Feb. 7th the analysis of our current assets should be completed,
                    by the middle of March the client can expect a first draft of the plan, and the final draft and deployment
                    of the new website can be expected to be completed by May 6th. </li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Audience -->
        <div class="audience">
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Target Audience:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Age:</b>18-40</li>
                        <li><b>Sex:</b> Both women and men</li>
                        <li><b>Education:</b> High School Diploma</li>
                        <li><b>Technology competency:</b> Low level - able to operate the internet or social media</li>
                        <li><b>Race:</b> All</li>
                        <li><b>Income level:</b> Middle Income</li>
                        <li><b>Other:</b> Families and college students</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>What do they think of us?</b> The audience likely thinks that the Popcorn Store is a casual small business
                    since it is family owned and with only one store.</li>
                <li><b>Why should they care about our project and products?</b> The target audience should care because people
                    generally want to support small business and those that are family owned. To the audience it can mean that
                    the business puts more care into their product and are not like big corporations who just want to get money.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Competitiors -->
        <div class="competitors">
            <h3>Competitors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Direct competitiors:</b> Other novelty food stores in Arlington, Texas, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Potato Corner</li>
                        <li>Flyboy's Salsa</li>
                        <li>Wally's Pickles</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li><b>Indirect competitiors:</b> Amazon and other online markets.</li>
                <li><b>What are they telling the audience that WE should also be telling them?</b> Our strong local competitors are
                    telling the customer base that the products they are selling are strong, handmade, quality goods that carry behind
                    them a storied history. We believe that The Popcorn Store can also adopt this marketing strategy to entice customers
                    into our store knowing they are buying a quality product made with passion.</li>
                <li><b>What makes us unique from the competition?</b> While most of our local competitors also shoot for a homemade
                    angle, when competing with other popcorn fronts, specifically online ones, The Popcorn Store offers a homemade
                    passionate quality that won’t be felt as strongly when buying from online stores. Not only this, but when compared
                    to our local competitors The Popcorn Store has a wide variety of flavors and selections that keeps our customer base broad.</li>

        <!-- Tone -->
        <div class="tone">
            <h3>Tone</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>What tone should we use to communicate to our target audience? Why?</b> Considering the broad audience that The
                    Popcorn Store caters to, we want to take a family-friendly and positive approach to the tone; in that way, no one
                    feels left out. We can accomplish this using fun jargon, puns, or other literary devices -- in addition to using a
                    colorful color palette.</li>
                <li><b>What adjectives describe the feeling we are trying to project or our approach?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fun</li>
                        <li>Celebratory</li>

        <!-- Message -->
        <div class="message">
            <h3>Message</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>What are we saying with this piece exactly?</b> We want to convey that the Popcorn Store is the best place to get popcorn and to support local business.</li>
                <li><b>Are the words already developed or do we need to develop them?</b> Words are already developed, but I think we can make it more effective for a website and mobile design.</li>
                <li><b>What do we want audiences to take away?</b> We want the audience to learn about what the Popcorn store has to offer in flavors, products, and the location and store hours.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Visuals-->
        <div class="visuals">
            <h3>Visuals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Are we developing new images or picking up existing ones?</b> We will be using the existing images on the website and Facebook page.</li>
                <li><b>If we are creating them, who / what / where are we photographing or illustrating? And why?</b> We are not creating them.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Details -->
        <div class="details">
            <h3>Details</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Is there any mandatory information that must be included?</b> Inline with our client’s needs, the redesign must include the specific products and services that they already offer. This includes different decorative popcorn tins, flavors, and bag sizes. The information should be easy to find and read, with backing text or visuals.</li>
                <li><b>List of deliverables? Preconceived ideas? Format parameters? Limitations and restrictions? Timeline, schedule, budget?</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The deliverables should include a majority of the images and text already existing on The Popcorn Store website; a variety of .jpg and .png photos that showcase their products and services. Moreover, the image and text content should be legible and high-quality on any user device -- with paragraph content being center-aligned and justified.</li>
                        <li>Based on their current messaging, The Popcorn Store wants to ensure that the redesign includes the family-friendly and local-business feeling that they’ve created -- extending to any written, audio, or visual content outside of what’s already provided. If we use a new color palette, it should include a similar shade of red to that of their logo. Outside links (to social media or other) should open in a new tab.</li>
                        <li>The project should be completed in a three-month timespan, by the end of March. Budget is negotiable based on outside content needed to complete the redesign.</li>

                <li><b>Informed of progress:</b> Professor Cucalon is the one that needs to be informed of our progress with the redesign. We may do so through email, Microsoft Teams, or Canvas. We should be checking in with him often; a weekly status report would be best to ensure that the project remains on track and any questions get answered.</li>
